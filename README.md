## Learning Outcomes

- Use the **Robot Operating System (ROS) framework** to build a robot
  application
- Perform **state estimation** using fiducial markers (used ArUco markers)
- Plan robot movements using a **graph-based motion planning**
  algorithm (used A Star algorithm)
- Send control signals to a robot that will guide a human user (Used RPi GPIO with ROS messages)
- Understand and **integrate various sub-fields of robotics** such as state
  estimation, motion planning, and controls towards developing a smart assistive cane
